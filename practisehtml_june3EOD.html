<h4 style="background-color:gray;color: white;border:2px solid red">style with color name</h4>
<p style="background-color:gray;color: rgb(0,255,0);border:5px solid rgb(255,0,0);">style with RGB</p>
<h4 style="background-color:#ff00ff;color:black;border: 2px solid #0000ff;">style with hex values of color</h4>
<p style="background-color:rgba(255,100,90,0.5);border:2px solid black;">style with rgba values a stands for alpha with states transparency. 0.0 for fully transparent and 1.0 for not transparent at all. when we mention a=0 not matter what the color is for background-color attribute.it will display the background color of the body</p>
<p style="background-color:rgba(255,100,90,1);color:rgba(0,0,255,1);border:2px solid black;">style with a=1 for the same above color</p>
<p>HSL stands for hue, saturation and lightness. hue is degree of the color on a color wheel from 0 to 360 degrees. s for saturation, the percentage value 0% means fully gray and 100% means we can see the color, l for lightness its also %, 0% means black, 50% means neither light nor dark,100% means white</p>
<p>h stands for hue. 0-120 is red, 120-240 is green and 240-360 is blue</p>
<p>in saturation its the purity of the color. gray will be mixed with each % value other than 0,because 0% means gray.when s=0% its completely gray.when s=50% it means 50% of the color is mixed with gray color bt still we can see and say what color it is. when s=100% its the full color without any gray </p>
<p style="background-color:hsl(100,50%,0%);color:white;">this style has only h in color</p>
<p style="background-color:hsl(0,50%,20%);color:white;">this has s style in color</p>
<p style="background-color:hsl(0,0%,50%);">this has only l style in color</p>
<p>in hsla a means again alpha</p>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook link using a tag</a>
<a href="/home/anila/Desktop/DL projects/DL projects/class 4/images/logo.png">this is image using a tag</a>
<p>a tag has target attribute which specifies the item in href attri to be displayed in the same window or separate window or separate tab</p>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">facebook target=blank</a>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_self">facebook target=self</a>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_top">facebook target=top</a>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_parent">facebook target=parent</a>
<p>target=parent for opening the webpage in the parent frame</p>
<p>showing image as link. first a tag then inside it img tag</p>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com"><img src="/home/anila/Desktop/DL projects/DL projects/class 3/images/facebook.png" width="50px" height="90px" border="2px"></a>
<p>title attribute can also be used for links so that when we mouse hover the link and hand cursor appears so along with hand cursor the title which is the tooltip also appears.the text given for title attri will be displayed as tooltip for that link</p>
<a href="http://www.google.com" title="this is google home page">Google</a>
<p> using html links we can also create bookmarks. bookmarks allow users to jump from one part of web page to another. especially when the web page is too long. example when fist listed the list of contents and the detailed description later, its very exhausting to scroll up and down. so if we create bookmarks and click on any of the list of contents then it will directly navigate to the detailed description</p>

<h3>Tables</h3>
<p>by default th table headings are bold and centered.td data containers of the table can contain all sorts of data like other tables,images,text,links,lists etc. a table has to be specified with borders if not it will be displayed without any borders. and the borders should be given to all table th td. using border-collapse property is important esp when using solid if not it will be displayed in double lines.if we say border-collapse: collapse then btwen td double lines will go and only single line as solid will be displayed.<br>for the below table we did not use any css for table th and td so its displaying border for only table as we have given only for it</p>

<table style="border: 2px solid black;border-spacing: 10px;">
	<tr>
		<th>Deal ID</th>
		<th>Deal Description</th>
		<th>No of Alerts</th>
		<th>Sub-Scenario</th>
		<th>MAR Score</th>
		<th>CRAF score</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>abcd1234</td>
		<td>Spoofing</td>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>Layering</td>
		<td>5.45</td>
		<td>3</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>max1765</td>
		<td>Fixing window</td>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>specific</td>
		<td>3.34</td>
		<td>2</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>we can always align the data in the table using text-align with values left r right. border-spacing for giving space between the cells. and border-spacing has no effect when border-collapse is used</p>
<table style="border: 2px solid black;border-spacing:5px;">
	<tr>
		<th style="text-align: left;">Deal ID</th>
		<th>Deal Description</th>
		<th>No of Alerts</th>
		<th>Sub-Scenario</th>
		<th>MAR Score</th>
		<th>CRAF score</th>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>suppose for two columns in a table should come under a single row means for two or more data cells there should be a same th, then use colspan attri. here colspan=2 </p>
<table class="table3">
	<tr class="tr31">
		<th>First Name</th>
		<th>Last Name</th>
		<th colspan="2">Phone No.</th>
	</tr>
	<tr class="tr32">
		<td>Anila</td>
		<td>Sekhar</td>
		<td>8974124521</td>
		<td>9985746412</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Make rowspan for making the td in a single row. we can also add a caption to the table like a heading saying what the table is abt. this can be done using caption tag</p>
<table style="border:2px solid green;border-spacing:3px;padding:2px;">
	<caption>Personal Details</caption>
	<tr>
		<th>First name</th>
		<td>Anila</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th rowspan="2">Ph no</th>
		<td>89546123</td>		
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>04478598</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>451475485</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>try using caption at the closing tag of the table</p>
<table style="border:2px solid green;border-spacing:3px;padding:2px;">
	
	<tr>
		<th>First name</th>
		<td>Anila</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th rowspan="2">Ph no</th>
		<td>89546123</td>		
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>04478598</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>451475485</td>
	</tr>
	<caption>Personal Details</caption>	
</table>
<p>so no matter where you place the caption tag either right after the starting table tag or while closing table tag, it will be displayed on the top of the table like a heading and centered wrt table. if we place it between the tr tags, it will change the table structure</p>
<table id="spltable01">
	<tr>
		<th>FirstName</th>
		<th>Lastname</th>
		<th>address</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>anila</td>
		<td>sekhar</td>
		<td>home</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>priya</td>
		<td>chandu</td>
		<td>office</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>priyanka</td>
		<td>varanasi</td>
		<td>park</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<h3>Summary of table</h3>
<ol>
	<li> table tag for creating the table</li>
	<li>tr for table row, th for table heading which get displayed as column name, td for table data</li>
	<li>border attribute--- for table th and td. it gives border to the table and the table cells. even if we specify as solid that it should display as single line between cells it will be displayed as double lines between cells</li>
	<li>border-collapse -- so when it comes as double lines btwn cells, to make it display as solid.the borders will combine into one.so should be used when table,th,td --> border and border-collapse</li>
	<li>cell padding -- gives space a gap btwn cell data and its border.so it should be given to th and td</li>
	<li>text-align --- gives alignment to the text in left,right and center. give it for th,td.</li>
	<li>th will be by default bold and centered</li>
	<li>border-spacing --gives spaces btwen cells in a table and shld not be used when border-collapse attri is used. so mention it for table</li>
	<li>colspan -- to combine 2 or more columns. rowspan -- to combine 2 or more rows</li>
	<li>caption tag -- to add caption to a table</li>
	<li>to give spl styles to a table give id to the table</li>
	<li>we can specify more styles using css. suppose if alternate rows have to be displayed in white and gray bgcolor then use table#t01 tr:nth-child(even) </li>
	<li>colgroup tag and inside there are col tags..so these tags are used to specify a particular style to specific columns. use colspan for col tags, if colspan=2 then first 2 column will have that style</li>
	<li>there are other tags for table as well like thead,tfoot,tbody</li>
	<li>thead for headings of the column names of the table.for th,tr inside thead.</li>
	<li>tfoot will be displayed in the last row of the table</li>


</ol>

<h4>About Lists</h4>
<p>There are different types of list types.by default unordered list takes round dots.so other types of bullets like circle,square,disc.so this can be acheived through list-style-type and values will be circle,disc,square and none.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li>list</li>
	<li>style type is</li>
	<li>cicle</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>instead of mentioning type of ol everytime, we can use start attribute in ol.if start=10, the list number would start from 10</p>
<ol start="10">
	<li>this</li>
	<li>list has</li>
	<li>start=10</li>
</ol>
<p>we can create menu or nav bar using lists and make them display horizontally using certain css props like float left for li elements</p>
<hr>
<h4>Blocks</h4>
<hr>
<h4>iframes</h4>
<p>a frame is used to display a webpage within a webpage.in an iframe tag there is src for url of webpage to be displayed, height and width of frame to be displayed.if no measurement is mentioned for height and width like height=100, it means by default its pixels(px) and % can also be given</p>
<iframe src="/home/anila/Desktop/DL projects/DL projects/class 4/class4task.html" height="200" width="800"></iframe>
<p>so in place of url in src attribute, any webpage url like facebook,google or any other thing is not working. it should be any html page extension of html.</p>
<p>now this frame comes with a border, so if to remove the border then should use css prop border:none inside style</p>
<iframe src="/home/anila/Desktop/DL projects/DL projects/class 4/class4task.html" height="200" width="800" style="border:none;"></iframe>
<p>now give some border stylings to the frame</p>
<iframe src="/home/anila/Desktop/DL projects/DL projects/class 4/class4task.html" height="200" width="800" style="border:2px solid red;"></iframe>
<p>another attribute in target attribute of links came across with frames that is iframe.so when any link is clicked the respective href will be displayed inside the frame.for this to happen first define iframe and give a name to it.2nd define anchor tag and mention its target=iframe name</p>
<iframe src="/home/anila/Desktop/DL projects/DL projects/class 4/class4task.html" height="200" width="100%" name="googleframe"></iframe>
<p>To refer for more html tags click here <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="googleframe">W3 schools</a></p>
<p>even if we mention website urls for href or src in iframe, the frame mentioned shld display the webpage but here <b>its not displaying. have to find out what d problm is...</b></p>
<hr style="border-color:red;">
<h4>Forms</h4>
<p>main tag for all form elements is form tag</p>
<form>
	<input type="text" name="fName">
	<input type="radio" name="radiobtn">
	<input type="submit" name="submitbtn">
</form>
<p>now creating a simple form with firstname last name gender and submit btn</p>
<form>
	<p>First Name:</p>
	<input type="text" name="firstname">
	<p>Last Name:</p>
	<input type="text" name="lastname">
	<p>Gender:</p>
	<input type="radio" name="Male">
	<input type="radio" name="Female">
	<input type="submit" name="Submitbtn">
</form>
<p>here for type radio name is given as male and female bt its not displayed so the name attri is not the one which gets displayed for that input element.so how to get values for those two radio btns of Gender.</p>
<p>its by giving another attribute called value, value=female or male</p>
<form>
	<p>Gender:</p>
	<input type="radio" name="femaleradio" value="Female">
	<input type="radio" name="maleradio" value="Male">
</form>
<p>no still its not displayed.</p>
<p>so for radio btns there is no attribute to get displayed the text for that radiobtn. whatever the option male,female,white,black or any other option can be just written just after the input tag</p>
<form>
	<p>Gender:</p>
	<input type="radio" name="female">Female
	<input type="radio" name="male">Male
</form>
<p>oh yes now the text came for both the radiobtns</p>
<p> value attribute also works that means the value assigned to value attri is displayed actually for type text and submit btn.in case of type=text, the value mentioned in input type text is displayed in the rect box. and in type=submit, the vlaue will be displayed as text of the btn</p>
<form>
	<p>First name</p>
	<input type="text" name="firname" value="anila">
	<input type="submit" value="Submitt">
</form>
<p>The form filled and when clicked on submit btn, the form will be posted for validating. and the end result like in other websites "Thanks for contacting! we will contact you soon" or "Application submitted". so such messages will be displayed</p>
