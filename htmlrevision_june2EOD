<h4 style="background-color:gray;color: white;border:2px solid red">style with color name</h4>
<p style="background-color:gray;color: rgb(0,255,0);border:5px solid rgb(255,0,0);">style with RGB</p>
<h4 style="background-color:#ff00ff;color:black;border: 2px solid #0000ff;">style with hex values of color</h4>
<p style="background-color:rgba(255,100,90,0.5);border:2px solid black;">style with rgba values a stands for alpha with states transparency. 0.0 for fully transparent and 1.0 for not transparent at all. when we mention a=0 not matter what the color is for background-color attribute.it will display the background color of the body</p>
<p style="background-color:rgba(255,100,90,1);color:rgba(0,0,255,1);border:2px solid black;">style with a=1 for the same above color</p>
<p>HSL stands for hue, saturation and lightness. hue is degree of the color on a color wheel from 0 to 360 degrees. s for saturation, the percentage value 0% means fully gray and 100% means we can see the color, l for lightness its also %, 0% means black, 50% means neither light nor dark,100% means white</p>
<p>h stands for hue. 0-120 is red, 120-240 is green and 240-360 is blue</p>
<p>in saturation its the purity of the color. gray will be mixed with each % value other than 0,because 0% means gray.when s=0% its completely gray.when s=50% it means 50% of the color is mixed with gray color bt still we can see and say what color it is. when s=100% its the full color without any gray </p>
<p style="background-color:hsl(100,50%,0%);color:white;">this style has only h in color</p>
<p style="background-color:hsl(0,50%,20%);color:white;">this has s style in color</p>
<p style="background-color:hsl(0,0%,50%);">this has only l style in color</p>
<p>in hsla a means again alpha</p>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook link using a tag</a>
<a href="/home/anila/Desktop/DL projects/DL projects/class 4/images/logo.png">this is image using a tag</a>
<p>a tag has target attribute which specifies the item in href attri to be displayed in the same window or separate window or separate tab</p>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">facebook target=blank</a>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_self">facebook target=self</a>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_top">facebook target=top</a>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_parent">facebook target=parent</a>
<p>target=parent for opening the webpage in the parent frame</p>
<p>showing image as link. first a tag then inside it img tag</p>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com"><img src="/home/anila/Desktop/DL projects/DL projects/class 3/images/facebook.png" width="50px" height="90px" border="2px"></a>
<p>title attribute can also be used for links so that when we mouse hover the link and hand cursor appears so along with hand cursor the title which is the tooltip also appears.the text given for title attri will be displayed as tooltip for that link</p>
<a href="http://www.google.com" title="this is google home page">Google</a>
<p> using html links we can also create bookmarks. bookmarks allow users to jump from one part of web page to another. especially when the web page is too long. example when fist listed the list of contents and the detailed description later, its very exhausting to scroll up and down. so if we create bookmarks and click on any of the list of contents then it will directly navigate to the detailed description</p>
